First, open Chrome file location In my case, the Chrome location(use start in: path) is

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

Next, in the command prompt, navigate to the Chrome directory using the command cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

Then,

use the command

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=8080 --user-data-dir="enter your localhost path here"

to open Chrome with remote debugging enabled. In my case, the command was

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=8080 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost"

then new terminal in that folder and enter map.py (letter l not one)

After opening Chrome, paste the following two lines of code from the script into the command prompt and hit enter. This will open the google map URL in Chrome, automatically...

That's it! The URL will open in the previously opened localhost Chrome and do auto ratings...

Finally, in the command prompt, enter "pip install Random" and hit enter to install the necessary library.
